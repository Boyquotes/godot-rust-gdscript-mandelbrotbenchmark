# godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
a benchmark between gdscript and godot-rust.   
the easiest way is to replace the helloworldexample in godot-rust and build with cargo build.   
then you can import in godot 3.4    
it draws two mandelbrot, left with gdscript, right with godot-rust    
and the time in milliseconds is displayed.   
the result in speed is comparable to csharp and c++ -   
but in my personal opinion godot-rust is the winner from the feeling. godot-rust feels cool.
