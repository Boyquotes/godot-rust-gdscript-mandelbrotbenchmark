# godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
a benchmark between gdscript and godot-rust.   
the easiest way is to replace the helloworldexample in godot-rust and build with cargo build.   
then you can import in godot 3.4    
the result is comparable to csharp and c++
