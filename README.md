# godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
godot-rust-gdscript-mandelbrotbenchmark
a benchmark between gdscript and godot-rust.   
the easiest way is to replace the helloworldexample in godot-rust and build with cargo build.   
then you can import in godot 3.4    
it draws two mandelbrot, left with gdscript, right with godot-rust    
and the time in milliseconds is displayed.   
the result is comparable to csharp and c++
